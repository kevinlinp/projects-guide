# Projects Guide

Here's a selection of my active-enough personal coding projects.

* [Home Screen](https://github.com/kevinlinp/home_screen) – My personal implementation of a browser homepage mimicing the heydays of [iGoogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGoogle). See the README for the latest.
* [Event Rego](https://github.com/kevinlinp/event-rego) – A small Meteor event management app meant for small clubs to collect activity fees. It helps an admin track cash payments, but it also allows club members to send money via PayPal's [checkout.js](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/express-checkout/integration-jsv4/).
* [Orders](https://github.com/kevinlinp/orders) – A historic order visualization for a single event on EventBrite. Collects data via [orders_job](https://github.com/kevinlinp/orders_job).
* [Lightbox](https://github.com/kevinlinp/lightbox) – Translates Ardiuno LED pattern-generation C code to JavaScript so that a preview of the program's display output can seen in a browser. Meant to run locally; instant previews as soon as the C file is saved.
